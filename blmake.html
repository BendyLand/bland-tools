        <h1>blmake</h1>
        <em>This project is in its very early stages and is non-functional as of 8/13/24</em>
        
        <p>A simple and straightforward build tool for C/C++!</p>
        
        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>
            <em>blmake</em> is the third and final project in my series of build tools.<br>
            The other two (<em>blrun</em> and <em>blbld</em>), are meant for smaller projects, while blmake is designed for larger, more complex projects.<br>
            Although blmake has a steeper learning curve, it offers more functionality for situations where the other tools fall short.<br>
            My goal is for it to be far simpler to use than traditional build tools like CMake.

        <div class="lists">
                <p>Here is a quick overview of all three tools:</p>
                <strong>blrun</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>The smallest of the build tools.</li>
                    <li>Use for small compiled projects that don't include external dependencies.</li>
                    <li>There may be several files.</li>
                    <li>There is only a command to compile and run the project.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <strong>blbld</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>A moderate sized build tool.</li>
                    <li>Use for projects that may have extra includes (-I) or for projects with a slightly more in depth directory structure.</li>
                    <li>There may be several files and basic dependencies, like an extra Include path.</li>
                    <li>There are more commands to compile individual files, compile everything to an object file (.o), compile everything directly, etc.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <strong>blmake</strong> (this project) 
                <ul>
                    <li>The largest of the build tools.</li>
                    <li>Use for projects that would normally warrant the usage of something like CMake.</li>
                    <li>*Commands TBD*</li>
                    <li>Rather than defining its own custom syntax, `blmake` expects a lua file called "blmake.lua".</li>
                </ul>
