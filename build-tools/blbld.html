        <h1>Bland Build Tool (blbld)</h1>
        <h2 id="github"><a href="https://github.com/BendyLand/blbld">See it on GitHub!</a></h2>
        <p>A simple build tool for C/C++ projects!</p>

        <h2>Usage</h2>
        <p>
            The intended usage for this tool is to simplify the process of building projects that contain many files, but only a few that are changing at a given moment.<br>
            <strong>Note:</strong> This tool was created with C/C++ in mind. While it may, by chance, work with other languages, its behavior will likely not be consistent. I have another, more generic tool: <a href="blrun.html">blrun</a> that may give better results in other languages.<br>
            This tool relies on a configuration file called `blbld.toml`. If this file does not exist, the program will prompt you for all of the necessary information, then generate the file for you.<br> 
            Currently, there are a few ways to interact with the CLI (For these examples '`blbld`' is going to act as the CLI command.):<br>
        </p>

        <h3>Build Project Directly</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>`blbld`: You can run the tool without any arguments.</li>
            <li>This will parse the config file (or give you the prompts to generate one), construct a direct build command (e.g. `g++ -std=c++20 one.cpp two.cpp -o main`), and run it.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Compile All Files</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>`blbld compile`: You can also compile all of the files to their corresponding '.o' files, but does not link them.</li>
            <li>This step is necessary to be able to link individual files back to the rest of the project. While the purpose of this tool is to avoid compiling the entire project every time, everything will still need to be compiled once at the start to be available to use. Luckily, this step is only necessary once.</li>
            <li>The output of this command will be all of the corresponding object files (e.g. `one.cpp` and `two.cpp` would become `one.o` and `two.o`).</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Compile Individual File</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>`blbld compile file.cpp`: This is the important step; you can compile an individual file to its corresponding object file without touching the others.</li>
            <li>This will compile a singular .cpp file to a singular .o file.</li>
        </ul>
    
        <h3>Build Compiled Files</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>`blbld build`: This is the step you take after compiling a single file.</li>
            <li>This will link all of the object files and compile them to the final binary.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Compile Single File then Build Compiled Files</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>`blbld update file.cpp`: This combines the previous two steps into one command.</li>
            <li>It will simply run the functions to compile a single file, then build the compile files back to back.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Print the Full Build Command</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>`blbld print`: This constructs the command from `blbld` and prints it to the console.</li>
            <li>This can be handy if you want to copy the command without running, to add things additional flags (such as -g).</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Note:</strong> In commands that result in an executable (such as `build`), including `mv` as an additional argument will move the binary to the same directory as the source files. Omitting this argument will keep its path strict to the specified output argument (-o). You may also include `debug` with various commands or on its own to include '-g' with the compilation command.</p>

        <h2>Examples</h2>
        <em>This project contains a `test` directory with some simple C++ files. To reset this directory, run `rm test/*.o test/main`.</em>
        <p>The simplest way to run the project is with Go's toolchain:</p>
        <em>No arguments</em><br>
        <div class="code">
            <code>
                go run .<br>
                # will run:<br>
                g++ -std=c++20 test/one.cpp test/two.cpp test/three.cpp -o main<br>
                # and produce:<br>
                # test/main (an executable binary)<br>
            </code>
        </div>
        <br>
        <em>Compiling all files:</em><br>
        <div class="code">
            <code>
                go run . compile<br>
                # will run:<br>
                g++ -std=c++20 -c test/one.cpp test/two.cpp test/three.cpp<br>
                # and produce:<br>
                # test/one.o test/two.o test/three.o<br>
            </code>
        </div>
        <br>
        <em>Compiling single file:</em><br>
        <div class="code">
            <code>
                go run . compile two.cpp<br>
                # will print:<br>
                # Compiling 'two.cpp'... <br>
                # and produce:<br>
                # test/two.o<br>
            </code>
        </div>
        <br>
        <em>Building compiled files:</em><br>
        <div class="code">
            <code>
                go run . build mv<br>
                # will run: br>
                g++ -std=c++20 test/*.o -o main<br>
                # and produce:<br>
                # test/main (an executable binary)<br>
            </code>
        </div>
        <br>
        <em>Updating single file:</em><br>
        <div class="code">
            <code>
                go run . update two.cpp<br>
                # will print:<br>
                # Compiling 'two.cpp'... <br>
                # and produce:<br>
                # test/two.o<br>
                # then it will run: br>
                g++ -std=c++20 test/*.o -o main<br>
                # and produce:<br>
                # main (an executable binary)<br>
            </code>
        </div>
        <br>
        <em>Printing the full command:</em><br>
        <div class="code">
            <code>
                go run . print<br>
                # will print:<br>
                g++ -std=c++20 bigtest/src/*.o -I bigtest/src/include -o main<br>
            </code>
        </div>

        <h2>Future Plans</h2>

        <p>I would like to be able to automate more of these steps. Ideally, I would like a single command to be able to rebuild the project when editing a single file (out of many).</p>
