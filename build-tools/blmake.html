        <h1>blmake</h1>
        <em>This project is in its fairly early stages as of Sep. 7, 2024. Functionality is limited and unpredictable.</em>
        
        <p>A simple and straightforward build tool for C/C++!</p>
        
        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>
            <em>blmake</em> is the third and final project in my series of build tools.
            The other two (<em>blrun</em> and <em>blbld</em>), are meant for smaller projects, while blmake is designed for larger, more complex projects.
            Although blmake has a steeper learning curve, it offers more functionality for situations where the other tools fall short.
            My goal is for it to be far simpler to use than traditional build tools like CMake.
        </p>
        
        <div class="lists">
                <p>Here is a quick overview of all three tools:</p>
                <strong>blrun</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>The smallest of the build tools.</li>
                    <li>Use for small compiled projects that don't include external dependencies.</li>
                    <li>There may be several files.</li>
                    <li>There is only a command to compile and run the project.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <strong>blbld</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>A moderate sized build tool.</li>
                    <li>Use for projects that may have extra includes (-I) or for projects with a slightly more in depth directory structure.</li>
                    <li>There may be several files and basic dependencies, like an extra Include path.</li>
                    <li>There are more commands to compile individual files, compile everything to an object file (.o), compile everything directly, etc.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <strong>blmake</strong> (this project) 
                <ul>
                    <li>The largest of the build tools.</li>
                    <li>Use for projects that would normally warrant the usage of something like CMake.</li>
                    <li>Rather than defining its own custom syntax, `blmake` will expect a lua file called "blmake.lua".</li>
                    <li>There are commands to generate the config file and [will be commands to] run various parts of the build process.</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The command to generate a config file is `blmake gen [option]`.</li>
                        <li>The options are: `full`, `build`, `simple`, `tiny`, and `test`. Leaving the option blank will default to `full`.</li>
                        <li><em><strong>Note:</strong> The command `blmake` is not available by default on your system. You will need to build the project, rename the binary, and give it executable permissions to use it in this way.</em></li>
                    </ul>
                    <li><em>Build commands TBD.</em></li>
                </ul>
