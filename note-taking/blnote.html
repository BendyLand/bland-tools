        <em>This project is in its early stages of development as of 7/27/24 and is functional, but unstable.*</em>
        
        <p>
            A note taking application which displays your notes as interconnected nodes.<br><br>
        
            This tool is meant to hold and connect a bunch of small, single-thought notes that link together to form a larger idea.<br>
            It is *not* meant to hold and organize several full-sized notes, like a notebook does.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Usage</h2>
        
        <p>Currently, it is easiest to run the project with Go's toolchain (go run .) and follow the prompts as they appear.</p>
        
        <div class="code">
            <code>
                go run .<br>
            </code>
        </div>
        <div class="code">
            <code>
                Welcome to blnote!<br>
                Please enter a command:<br>
            </code>
        </div>
        <p>If you are unsure of where to start, you can type 'help' to see the help menu:</p>
        <div class="code">
            <code>
                Please enter a command:<br>
                help<br><br>
                
                Welcome to the help menu!<br>
                The available commands are:<br>
                new <note name><br>
                link <node1> <node2><br>
                check <note_name><br>
                remove <note_name><br>
                read<br>
                show<br>
                help<br>
                exit<br><br>
            </code>
        </div>
        
        <p>
            Upon using the `exit` command, the program will write any saved nodes with their links to a file called `./NodeStorage/nodes.json`. If the directory does not exist, it should create it. To exit this program without saving your nodes to a file, you must use an interrupt signal, like Ctrl-C.<br><br>
        
            If you have used the tool previously, using the `read` command will load any saved nodes in the path from above. If no JSON file is found at the path, a message will be printed saying so, but the program will continue running. <br><br>
        
            <strong>Note:</strong> `link`ing nodes is purely visual. Right now, the only functionality it provides is that the note names will be displayed as being connected when `show` is used. This may help you to keep your ideas organized, but it does not provide any inherent functionality. <br>
            <ul>
                 <li>Additionally: there is a bug right now where if one of a pair of linked nodes is deleted, they will both still be displayed as if they exist. In the future, I plan to have the deleted node's name still be visible, but with some kind of denotation that is has been removed.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        
          
        <h2>Commands</h2>
        
        <strong>new</strong> [note name]<br>
        <ul>
            <li>Creates a new Node with the given name. Will prompt for text after entering name.</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Note: names cannot include whitespace yet. Anything past the first word will be omitted.</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>
        
        <strong>link</strong> [node1] [node2]<br>
        <ul>
            <li>Links [node2] to [node1]. For example:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>link node_one node_two</li>
                <li>node_one <- node_two (when they're displayed.)</li>
            </ul>
         </ul>
        
        <strong>check</strong> [note_name]
        <ul>
            <li>Displays the saved text from inside [note_name].</li>
        </ul>
         
        <strong>remove</strong> [note_name]
        <ul>
            <li>Removes [note_name] from your list.</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Note: if [note_name] contains a link, it will still be displayed when `show` is used. This is a bug.</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>
        
        <strong>read</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Attempts to read nodes from previous sessions. If no nodes exist, a message is printed saying so.</li>
        </ul>
         
        <strong>show</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Displays a list of any node names from your current session. Previous nodes must be `read` before they can be `show`n.</li>
            <ul>
                <li>This command does not display any of the text from the notes.</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>
        
        <strong>help</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Prints a list of commands which can be used.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <strong>exit</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Saves any nodes from your current session to './NodeStorage/nodes.json' then exits the program.</li>
            <li><strong>To exit without saving your current session, please use Ctrl-C. If you start a new session, then immediately `exit`, it will save a blank file.</strong></li>
        </ul>
